# Data_Dashboard_using_AWS

## Introduction
The purpose of this exercise is to make a Visualization Dashboard of World Population and hence making use of RESTFUL APIs (In this case, Method=GET is used). 

The exercise is conducted over AWS Platform using EC2 Instance.
### Requirements
import pandas as pd

import plotly.graph_objs as go

import json, plotly

from flask import render_template,Flask,jsonify,request

### 1. Data Preparation
This is commonly denoted as 80% of the process. From working with missing data to finding a way to work with categorical variables. Firstly, we defined a function for cleaning the 4 csv files given here. We took 'Country Name' and Years from '1990 to 2015' as our analysis period.


### 5. Evaluation
Results are the findings from our wrangling and analysis using visualizations. These are the answers I have found to each of the questions.
