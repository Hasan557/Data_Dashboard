# Data_Dashboard_using_AWS

## Introduction
A data dashboard is an information management tool that visually tracks, analyzes and displays key performance indicators (KPI), metrics and key data points to monitor the health of a business, department or specific process. They are customizable to meet the specific needs of a department and company. Behind the scenes, a dashboard connects to your files, attachments, services and APIâ€™s, but on the surface displays all this data in the form of tables, line charts, bar charts and gauges. A data dashboard is the most efficient way to track multiple data sources because it provides a central location for businesses to monitor and analyze performance. Real-time monitoring reduces the hours of analyzing and long line of communication that previously challenged businesses.

## Purpose
The purpose of this exercise is to make a Visualization Dashboard of World Population and hence making use of RESTFUL APIs (To know more about Restful APIs [here](https://pusher.com/tutorials/understanding-rest-api)).The exercise is conducted over AWS Platform using EC2 Micro Instance.

### 1. Data Preparation
This is commonly denoted as 80% of the process. From working with missing data to finding a way to work with categorical variables. Firstly, we defined a function for cleaning the 4 csv files. We took 'Country Name' and Years from '1990 to 2015' as our analysis period.
